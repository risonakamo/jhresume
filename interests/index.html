          <p>The web environment is one of my favourite places to program on.</p>
          <p>I find that I code best when I am doing it for fun, and when I really have a desire to get something done, I'll do it.</p>
          <p>The web really lets me program in a practical and artistic way, two things that I prioritise highly while writing.</p>
          <p>I love to stare at the developer console - when I see an interesting website I will often spend way too much time trying to figure out how it works</p>
          <p>I am always happy to see a web technology used in a way I'd never thought of before - the more I see the more I can do!</p>

          <p>As an avid gamer I spend a lot of time playing games.</p>
          <p>I like to expose myself to a wide variety of genres of games on all sorts of platforms, from mobile to web-based to engine-based.</p>
          <p>I have aspirations to become a game developer or net-game developer, I hope that one day I can become a contributor to one of the games I have played.</p>
          <p>My experience with games is a big factor in my artistic expression; I have many references to draw from.</p>

          <p>I am always looking at art and keeping an eye out for interesting design choices on the web</p>
          <p>I might not be able to draw (yet), but my exposure to art on the web leaves me with many references which I used to create new themes in my web applications.</p>
          <p>I like to design UI using different themes, even for small projects.</p>
          <p>I use Photoshop often to create graphics for fun to be shared with friends.</p>

        <div class="intbox-content">
          <p>Before I entered the Computer Science field, I was in the Engineering field for the majority of high school.</p>
          <p>This lead me to have more of a practical mentality when approaching computer science problems.  I like to solve things using light and efficient methods that work for general cases.</p>
          <p>I welcome access to new software, learning to use a new language or program is always an interesting challenge.  To this extent I have used an assortment of different tools and software throughtout my education experience.</p>
          <p>Although high-level languages like Javascript and Python are some of my favourite practical languages, I have worked with and am not uncomfortable around languages such as C or assembly, and I am always ready to learn more.</p>
