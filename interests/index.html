          <p>The web environment is one of my favourite mediums to program on, I have found it to be very practical and that
            it also allows a degree of artistic epxression.</p>
          <p>I learned web development through curiosity - one day I decided to sit down and figure out just what all these
            changing and colourful words in the Chrome Developer Tools meant. Much of my knowledge of web development and
            design is from just looking at interesting websites and seeing how they work. I am always happy to find CSS rules
            used in weird ways, and will often spend way too much time trying to pick apart how something on a webpage works.</p>
          <p>Most of the things I do with HTML and JS are small practical projects and experiments, made to be shared with friends.
            I find myself determined to finish these little experiments, even if it will only ever be shown once to a few
            people in a group chat. Whatever I start, I want to finish.</p>
          <p>I like to try out new frameworks and formats that build upon basic HTML and Javascript. From Chrome Extensions
            to Electron, I hope to see how far web development can go in the future.</p>
